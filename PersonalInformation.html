    <p class="presentation">My name is Viviana Manrique PÃ©rez, I am 34 years old and I am a math teacher by profession. However, all my life I have been interested in the field of technology and, in particular, in programming. In the last few years I have been able to learn in a formal way about some programming, markup and design languages. I am interested in starting to get experience in this field. <br> <br> <br> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/viviana-manrique-p%C3%A9rez-03b5a0186/">My LinkedIn profile</a> </p>
